# Dice Counter

A counter to see how often certain dice rolls come up.

## Description

A programme that displays an array of buttons each with a count.
When the button is pressed the count goes up by 1.
When the button is pressed athe total roll counter at the top goes up by 1 too.
Currently set up for a 20 sided die but can be changed with the Repository class's self.face_count variable.

The idea is that you can roll a die repeatedly and count the number of times any given face comes up to check if it is roughly a fair die.

## To-do

[X] Create a basic working counter for a d20.
[ ] Make it work with a die of any number of sides.
[ ] Allow saving and loading of data through a File menu in the window.
[ ] Allow changing of the number of buttons through a button under a File menu in the window.
[ ] Prevent overwriting of the default 0.json when saving.
[ ] Check if the average roll of the die agrees with the expected average within error.
